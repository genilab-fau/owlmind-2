# OwlMind 

The OwlMind Framework is being developed by The Generative Intelligence Lab at Florida Atlantic University to support education and experimentation with Hybrid Intelligence Systems. These solutions combine rule-based and generative AI (GenAI)-based inference to facilitate the implementation of local AI solutions, improving latency, optimizing costs, and reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions.

The framework is designed for both education and experimentation empowering students and researchers to rapidly build Hybrid AI-based Agentic Systems, achieving tangible results with minimal setup.
